Build and maintain data integration & process SDKs for use by internal services and product teams throughout Coinbase.
Design and build self-service applications to empower our users to manage and troubleshoot their own data pipelines running on our platforms.
Design and build services for end-to-end data security and data observability: managing access controls across multiple storage and access layers, tracking data quality, cataloging datasets and their lineage, usage auditing.
Convert functional requests from data analysts, ML, and security & compliance into reusable and scalable patterns; and assemble data microservices into data platforms for critical business verticals and user cohorts.

What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):

You have at least 5+ years of experience in software engineering.
You have Strong Python, Go, or Java backend development skills.
You have general experience working with data systems or data pipelines.

Imbue,"Software Engineer, Infrastructure","Summary
At Imbue, we leverage large amounts of compute to make our small research team more effective. This role is about enabling and supporting those large-scale compute efforts and all of the other software infrastructure that goes into making research a pleasant, seamless experience for the rest of the team, especially as we scale to increasingly higher scale systems.

Example projects


 Build and manage wrapper tools that allow code written for single hosts to scale seamlessly to large GPU clusters Debug distributed exceptions and improve our logging and tracing stack Design improvements to systems that manage secrets, configurations, ongoing jobs, and other stateful components of our software Search out and prototype possible additions to our software stack that can integrate and provide extra leverage to pain points in typical workflows Dig deeply into open-source or third-party code, including C/C++ libraries, to add debugging information or patch in performance improvements Work collaboratively with other members of the team to debug, provide guidance, and design software that is resilient to hardware and networking failures as well as third party tooling issues In summary: make good abstractions so that other engineers on the team can work at a higher level and everything else works seamlessly



You are


 A good software engineer.

You should understand the trade-offs of various approaches and technologies, and not be dogmatically tied to a single tool Careful and detail oriented. We do science and care deeply about the correctness of the results. Our infrastructure reflects this--we highly value robustness and ensuring that systems run reliably and correctly



Compensation And Benefits

 Work directly on creating software with human-like intelligence Generous compensation, equity, and benefits $20K+ yearly budget for self-improvement: coaching, courses, conferences, etc Actively co-create and participate in a positive, intentional team culture Spend time learning, reading papers, and deeply understanding prior work Frequent team events, dinners, off-sites, and hanging out Compensation packages are highly variable based on a variety of factors. If your salary requirements fall outside of the stated range, we still encourage you to apply. The range for this role is $170,000–$350,000 cash, $10,000–$2,000,000 in equity



How To Apply
All submissions are reviewed by a person, so we encourage you to include notes on why you're interested in working with us.

Wealthfront,Backend Engineer,"This role supports US-based remote work, or Palo Alto, CA based hybrid in-office.

About Wealthfront Engineering

Wealthfront’s culture centers around continuous learning, innovation, and quality-driven software development. With high quality software as our ultimate engineering objective, our key tactic is automation:

 Wealthfront software automates the financial services we provide to our clients, and within these services we automate the collection of data that we learn from on our way to making our services even better. Wealthfront engineers function as builder/operators, with dual responsibility for building the system and operating it in production. Any toil that this brings about is automated away by engineers. This investment in automation is expected, and the prioritization of it is always built into our planning and execution. Wealthfront engineers automate our development processes. For example, Wealthfront engineers automate all of our testing. Manual testing is not part of the software development lifecycle at Wealthfront. Wealthfront engineers automate observability in case of failure. If something is up, our systems inform engineers appropriately. If our systems are quiet, they are healthy.

If you are drawn to being an engineer within such an environment, and having outsized impact as an engineer at a magnitude that is only available within a company achieving greatness at our size (~250 employees, half in engineering), then we want to hear from you!

About The Role

We are looking for backend engineers to join our core product development teams. You’ll work with other engineers to design and build new features or enhance existing features. This work will add capabilities to the various backend systems and services that support Wealthfront’s products, and will be done with automated instrumentation and monitoring to require minimal operational maintenance.You’ll help improve the maintainability and stability of our codebase by fixing issues and adding necessary enhancements to our existing backend systems. You’ll ensure that mission critical backend systems and services operate smoothly in production by triaging and resolving operational issues as part of a team of on-call engineers. You’ll proactively identify opportunities for improving the reliability and scalability of our systems.Additionally, you might play a part in evolving the engineering organization by participating in recruiting activities such as interviewing and attending career fairs and providing mentorship to other engineers on the team.

About You

You have 2-6 years of experience in developing backend components, services or APIs in Java or a similar language. You demonstrate knowledge and understanding of distributed systems and functional programming paradigms. You have knowledge of SQL and experience working with online data stores (ideally something like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server but NoSQL is okay).You have passion for agile, test-driven development, continuous integration and automated testing. You also have a passion for working on platforms and backend systems that have measurable business impact and like working in a fast paced cross functional environment.While not required, experience working with Spark pipelines is a plus along with knowledge of an ORM technology such as Hibernate. Another plus is working with a dependency injection framework (one of Guice, Spring, Pico, Dagger).You have either a BS or MS in computer science or related field.

Once You Join, Wealthfront Will

Benefits include medical, vision, dental, 401K plan, generous time off, parental leave, wellness reimbursements, professional development, employee investing discount, and more!

About Wealthfront

Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built one of the first automated investment products that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee. We then expanded. We now work with partner banks to offer exceptional banking features through a Wealthfront Brokerage Cash Account, which makes it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $70 billion of our client’s hard earned money, pioneering the robo-advisor category and transforming the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions.

Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is more relevant than ever because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to expand their horizon, and easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies, make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially in a way that’s transformational to their lives and their long-term future.
